# School_District_Analysis
## OBJECTIVE ## 
Chief Data Scientist Maria works for a City School District. She is responsible for analyzing information from various sources. Maria inquired me to assist her with analyzing standardized testing data to report on trends. Upon review, the school board notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file showed evidence of academic dishonesty- specifically Thomas High School's ninth grade reading and math scores. In order to uphold state testing standards, the school board turned to Maria for help. Maria asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact; she also requested that I replace the math and reading scores, repeat the school district analysis from the module and describe how the changes effected the overall analysis.
